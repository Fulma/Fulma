# Fulma : Wrapper around Bulma.io

# ⚠️ Fulma is not actively maintained anymore

You should be able to use it with Bulma 0.9.3 and 0.9.4. However, Bulma v1 introduced breaking change so some things are supported and others are not.

Nowdays, I encourage people use the Feliz style syntax. You can see [a comparaison here](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Feliz/issues/155).

If you want to use Feliz syntax with Bulma, you can use [Feliz.Bulma](https://github.com/Dzoukr/Feliz.Bulma).

If someone want to maintain Fulma, I can invite them to the repository as maintainer.

If you are a company and need Fulma to be upgraded to a newer version, I am available as a freelancer.
